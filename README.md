Here are 10 live portfolio websites that are widely considered benchmarks for developers. They range from highly interactive 3D experiences to clean, minimalistic designs, helping you see different approaches to showcasing work.

Bruno Simon

URL: bruno-simon.com

Why it's a benchmark: This is arguably the most famous developer portfolio right now. It is a fully interactive 3D game where you drive a truck to explore his projects. It demonstrates mastery of WebGL and Three.js.

Brittany Chiang

URL <a href="brittanychiang.com">brittanychiang.com</a>

Why it's a benchmark: A gold standard for "clean and professional." It uses a single-page layout that is content-focused, highly accessible, and uses a sticky sidebar for navigation. It is often cited as a perfect template for backend/full-stack engineers who want to look polished without being "flashy".

Adham Dannaway

URL: adhamdannaway.com

Why it's a benchmark: Iconic for its "half-designer, half-coder" landing page. It visually splits his face to represent his dual skillset. It effectively communicates a "Hybrid" role instantly.

Jack Jeznach

URL: jacekjeznach.com

Why it's a benchmark: Known for incredibly smooth animations and transitions using GSAP. It feels like a high-end corporate site but remains deeply personal. It’s a great example of "front-end magic" that doesn't sacrifice usability.

Josh W. Comeau

URL: joshwcomeau.com

Why it's a benchmark: Focuses on "Delightful UX." His site is technically a blog/portfolio hybrid that uses whimsical interactions (sound effects, playful hover states) to show off technical skills rather than just listing them.

Jesse Zhou

URL: jesse-zhou.com

Why it's a benchmark: A gamified "Ramen Shop" experience. Similar to Bruno Simon, it immerses the user in a 3D world (a food stall) where you browse projects as items on a menu. It shows immense creativity and personality.

Lynn Fisher

URL: lynnandtonic.com

Why it's a benchmark: She redesigns her portfolio every single year with a completely new concept. It is famous for responsive design that changes drastically (and artistically) as you resize the browser window.

Olaolu Olawuyi

URL: olaolu.dev

Why it's a benchmark: A masterclass in high-contrast design and typography. It uses vibrant colors and bold text to stand out, distinct from the typical "dark mode" developer aesthetic.

Tamal Sen

URL: tamalsen.dev

Why it's a benchmark: The definition of "Elegant Minimalism." If you want to build a site that looks fantastic but is technically simple to maintain, this is the one to study. It uses subtle motion to feel premium.

Rauno Freiberg

URL: rauno.me

Why it's a benchmark: Incredible attention to detail in UI interaction. His "craft" is visible in the micro-interactions—how the cursor moves, how elements fade in, and the distinct "fluid" feel of the interface.
